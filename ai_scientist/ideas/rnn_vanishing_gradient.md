# Abstract
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used for sequential data modeling but suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which limits their ability to learn long-term dependencies. Additionally, their inherently sequential nature poses significant challenges for parallel computation, hindering scalability and training speed. This research aims to investigate innovative approaches that both alleviate gradient decay issues and enable more efficient parallelization strategies in RNN architectures. By combining theoretical analysis with empirical evaluation, the study seeks to advance the development of more robust and scalable RNN models suitable for complex sequential tasks.
